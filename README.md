# IMPORTANT
The first thing you will need to do before running this, is you need to create two files. If these are not created, an exception will be thrown and the program will tell you.<br><br> The required files are:<br>
<b>C:/Windows/!watchdogs/1.$WDSTATES</b><br>
<b>C:/Windows/!watchdogs/log.bin</b>

Once these files have been created, the program should be good to go!

# So what is this program exactly?
This is a rough python representation of what a watchdog timer does/is. A wikipedia article on a watchdog timer can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchdog_timer">here</a>

# Okay, but how can i tell that this won't harm my PC?
The basic function of this program is to write a '0' and a '1' to the file at <b>C:/Windows/!watchdogs/1.$WDSTATES</b> depending on the time. Since this is a github repository, and this is python, you can always just read the code to help on your judgement on whether or not to run the program :)

# What's the log.bin file used for then?
This is used when the watchdog timer fails a check, it will log the time and date in which the failure happened, much like what Windows would do it the case of a Bug Check (BSOD)
