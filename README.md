# IMPORTANT
The first thing you will need to do before running this, is you need to create two files. If these are not created, an exception will be thrown and the program will tell you.<br><br> The required files are:<br>
<b>C:\Windows\!watchdogs\1.$WDSTATES</b><br>
<b>C:\Windows\!watchdogs\log.bin</b>

Once these files have been created, the program should be good to go!
